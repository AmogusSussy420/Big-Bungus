Features
========

This mod adds a new radio station to your Pip-Boy 3000. 

The station plays 55 music tracks from the era of the Atomic 
Threat, including 29 authentic public service announcements from 
Civil Defense.

CONELRAD (Control of Electromagnetic [or Electronic] Radiation) was a method
of emergency broadcasting to the public of the United States in the event of
enemy attack. It was intended to serve two purposes; to prevent Soviet
bombers from homing in on American cities by using radio or TV stations as
beacons, and to provide essential civil defense information on 640-1240.

2 hours, 20 minutes of music across 55 tracks
22 minutes of PSAs & Civil Defense

The station is fully scripted as per official stations.
